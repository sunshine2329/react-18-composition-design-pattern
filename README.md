# react-container-presentation-pattern

React components typically contain a mix of logic and presentation. By logic, we refer to anything that is unrelated to the UI, such as API calls, data manipulation, and event handlers. The presentation is the part of the render where we create the elements to be displayed on the UI.

In React, there are simple and powerful patterns, known as container and presentational, which we can apply when creating components that help us to separate those two concerns.

Creating well-defined boundaries between logic and presentation not only makes components more reusable.
